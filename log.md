# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days 1- 9, before it occurred to me to put things on GitHub

**Progress**: Dataquest: 58% through Intro to Python. (Skipping anything that isn't included in the free package.)

**Thoughts:** First week was fun and exciting and now it's a bit of a struggle. I think it's an [extinction burst](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/07/07/extinction-burst/)

**Link to work:** not yet.

### Day 10: April 25, 2018
##### (five hashmarks looks like this - I don't really do Markup)

**Today's Progress**: 18% through Intermediate Python and Pandas

**Thoughts**: Last night was Crafting for Coders. It was scary to be in a room with all of these people who knew a whole culture that I don't know. I had to remind myself that things will feel different in a month or two. I'm glad these events will be monthly. It'll be a great way to mark my progress!

**Link(s) to work**: Maybe tomorrow. ;-)

### Day 11: April 26, 2018
**Progress**: Dataquest: 59% through Storytelling Through Data Visualization

**Thoughts**: It's starting to get good, now that I'm learning visuals. However, the fact that DQ keeps making me skip paid content is v annoying.
I want to make something with my FB data and put it out by mail tomorrow. We're supposed to go to vinyl night tonight though. I can't tell if my wish to bail on vinyl night is positive ('cause I want to code) or negative ('cause I want to be an introvert.)
